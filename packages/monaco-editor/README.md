# @nteract/monaco-editor

This package implements a React component with a Monaco-based code editor. To see this package in action, you can view the source code for rendering text files in the [nteract-on-Jupyter application](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/blob/master/applications/jupyter-extension/nteract_on_jupyter/app/contents/file/text-file.js).

## Installation

```
$ yarn add @nteract/monaco-editor
```

```
$ npm install --save @nteract/monaco-editor
```

## Usage

The example below shows how we can use this package to render an editor for plain-text content.

```javascript
import MonacoEditor from "@nteract/monaco-editor";

export default () => {
  return (
    <MonacoEditor
      id="foo"
      contentRef="bar"
      theme="vscode"
      language="plaintext"
      value={"These are some words in an editor."}
    />
  );
};
```

## Documentation

### Editor
The `monaco-editor` package provides the core functionality to render [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) as a React component. It also fetches code tab-completion items when running a notebook connected to a Jupyter kernel. To work well with the semantics of a notebook, the package requires the following props as laid down in the `IMonacoProps` interface:

* `id` - A unique identifier for the editor instance. In the notebook context, since every cell is tied to a single instance of the editor, `id` refers to the unique ID of the cell.
* `contentRef` - A unique identifier for the editor's host application. In the notebook context, `contentRef` provides a reference to the container element for the main notebook app component.
* `theme` - Theme to be used for rendering the component ([docs](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/api/interfaces/monaco.editor.idiffeditorconstructionoptions.html#theme))
* `language` - Valid language ID of a supported language (eg: `python`, `typescript`, `plaintext` etc.) Check out this Monaco Editor [playground](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/playground.html#extending-language-services-custom-languages) to add support for a language not yet supported out of the box.

Besides the minimum required props to instantiate the component, we also provide support for a host of optional properties and handlers. These optional properties are found:

`options` - Specify a list of supported [EditorOptions](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/api/interfaces/monaco.editor.ieditoroptions.html) as key-value pairs when instantiating the component

Important callbacks:
* `onChange: (value: string, event?: any) => void` - Contents of the editor are changed.
* `onFocusChange: (focus: boolean) => void` - The Editor Component loses or gains focus
* `onCursorPositionChange: (selection: monaco.ISelection | null) => void` - Cursor position changes


### Completions
The package also adds the capability to retrieve code-completion items from a connected Jupyter kernel. Completions are language-specific token recommendations when the user attempts to type or enumerate the attributes of a class/object (usually with a `dot` operator and the `tab` completion key). While we provide a default completion provider that works with the Jupyter kernel, we also support custom completion providers that users might want to register with their own language service.

The completion behavior is controlled by the following props:

* `enableCompletion` - Boolean flag to enable/disable the behavior entirely
* `shouldRegisterDefaultCompletion` - Boolean flag to enable/disable the default completion provider
* `onRegisterCompletionProvider?: (languageId: string) => void` - Custom completion provider implementation for a Monaco Editor supported language.

### Performance Tip

If you want to enable completions in your app when you use this package, it is ideal to do it on a [`Web worker`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) which is separate from the UI thread. This provides a performance boost and ensures that the app doesn't stall UI updates when the editor is waiting for completions from the Jupyter Kernel. In Nteract, we use the [Monaco Editor Web pack plugin](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor-webpack-plugin) to register and use the `editor` worker by Monaco. Check out the Monaco Editor [docs](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/blob/master/docs/integrate-esm.md) for more information on configuring the package and setting up web workers in a different set up.

Improving window resizing performance:
On resizing the browser window, the width of the container of this component is recalculated. Consider using these simple css overrides to further improve resizing performance:

```css
.monaco-container .monaco-editor {
  width: inherit !important;
}

.monaco-container .monaco-editor .overflow-guard {
  width: inherit !important;
}

/* 26px is the left margin for .monaco-scrollable-element  */
.monaco-container .monaco-editor .monaco-scrollable-element.editor-scrollable.vs {
  width: calc(100% - 26px) !important;
}
```
These style overrides for resize performance can also be found in the `@nteract/styles` package.
The CSS can be imported in a top level React component simply by doing:
```typescript
import "@nteract/styles/monaco/overrides.css";
```
