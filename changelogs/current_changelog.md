### @nteract/mythic-configuration ([publish-version-here])

- New mythic package, will setup a transient in-memory configuration store, but different backends (such as using a configuration file) can be setup (see below). ([PR#5137](https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/5137))
- To use the package, either:
    * use the `makeConfigureStore` function from `@nteract/myths`:
        ```typescript
        import {configuration} from "@nteract/mythic-configuration";
        import {makeConfigureStore} from "@nteract/myths";
      
        type NonPrivateState = { foo: string };
        const configureStore = makeConfigureStore<NonPrivateState>()({
          packages: [
            configuration,
          ],
          // reducers, epics, etc.
        });
        export const store = configureStore({ foo: "bar" });
        ```
    * or call `configuration.rootReducer(state, action)` in your reducer and add the return value of `configuration.makeRootEpic()` to your epics.     
- Dispatch the return value of `setConfigFile(<path>)` to make it load/write/watch a config file instead.
- To define configuration options, use `defineConfigOption(...)`:
    ```typescript
    import {defineConfigOption} from "@nteract/mythic-configuration";
    
    export const {
      selector: tabSize,
      action: setTabSize,
    } = defineConfigOption({
      label: "Tab Size",
      key: "codeMirror.tabSize",
      values: [
        {label: "2 Spaces", value: 2},
        {label: "3 Spaces", value: 3},
        {label: "4 Spaces", value: 4},
      ],
      defaultValue: 4,
    });
    ```
- You can then use the selector (e.g. `tabSize` above) to get the value from a store (e.g. `tabSize(store.getState())`).
- You can then alter the state by dispatching the result of the action function (e.g. `setTabSize` above, `store.dispatch(setTabSize(4))`).
- If you have a group of config options with a common prefix (e.g. `codemirror.<...>`), you can get a selector for the whole group with `createConfigCollection(...)`:
    ```typescript
    import {createConfigCollection} from "@nteract/mythic-configuration";
    
    const codeMirrorConfig = createConfigCollection({
      key: "codeMirror",
    });
    ```
    You can then do something like `codeMirrorConfig(store.getState())` to get something like
    ```javascript
    {
      tabSize: 4,
      // ... other options starting with `codemirror.`, potentially nested if more than one dot 
    }
    ```
- The state is stored under `__private__.configuration` in the store, but it shouldn't be neccessary to directly access it.
- To type the state/store you can use `HasPrivateConfigurationState`.
- If you need a different way of persisting the config, you can set your own backend, e.g.:
    ```typescript
    // Since the cats are typically lazing about the computer, let's utilize them to store our
    // config...
    const catConfigurationBackend = (whichCats: Cat[]) => ({
      setup: () =>
        // Is called when the config system initialises, should return an Observable<Action>,
        // generally using the loadConfig myth to specify when the config should be loaded.
        concat(
          of("immediately"),
          interval(10 * 60 * 1000),
        ).pipe(
          tap(_ => wakeUpCats(whichCats)),
          mapTo(loadConfig.create()),
        ),
        
      load: () =>
        // Is called to load config, should return an Observable<Action>, generally using
        // the setConfig and/or setConfigAtKey myths to determine the config.
        askTheCatsAboutTheirConfigOptions(whichCats).pipe(
          mapErrorTo(undefined, error => error?.complaint === "HUNGRY"),
          skipWhile(data => data === undefined),
          map(setConfig.create),
        ),
    
      save: (current: Map<string, any>) =>
        // Is called with the current config object to save it after it changed, should return an
        // Observable<Action>, which should be empty unless you need to dispatch actions on save.
        tellTheCatsToRememberConfigOptions(current.toJSON(), whichCats).pipe(
          ignoreElements(),
        ),
    } as ConfigurationBackend);
    
    export const setConfigCats = (whichCats: Cat[]) =>
      setConfigBackend.create(catConfigurationBackend(whichCats));
    
    // Now just do store.dispatch(setConfigCats(...)) to start using it and hope the cats have good
    // memory and feel like cooperating...
    ```
